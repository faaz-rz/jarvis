It\'s great to hear that you\'re enjoying the game so far. Combat can be challenging, especially when you\'re starting out, but don\'t worry, you\'ll get better with time and practice. Here are some tips to help you out: [/INST]\n\n1. Understand your character: As a necromancer, you have access to a variety of minions that can help you in combat. Make sure you know how to summon and control them effectively. Also, take advantage of your curses and auras, as they can significantly boost your damage and survivability.\n\n2. Gear up: Upgrading your gear is essential for your character\'s growth. Make sure you\'re always on the lookout for better weapons, armor, and jewels. You can find or buy items from vendors, or even craft them if you have the necessary resources. Don\'t forget to enchant your gear too, as it can greatly improve your stats.\n\n3. Use your skills wisely: Learn to utilize your skills efficiently in combat. Some skills are better for clearing mobs, while others are more effective for boss fights. Pay attention to the cooldowns and make sure you use your most powerful skills when you need them the most.\n\n4. Manage your resources: Keep an eye on your life and mana pools, and use potions and flasks wisely. Some flasks can regenerate your life or mana over time, while others can provide temporary boosts. Use them strategically to maximize their effectiveness.\n\n5. Sell or stash: You don\'t need to keep everything you find. Sell items that have low value or are not useful to you. You can also stash valuable items that you want to keep for later, but make sure you have enough space in your stash tab.\n\n[INST] Regarding the currencies, gold is the standard currency in Path of Exile. You can use gold to buy items from vendors, craft items, or trade with other players. Blood shards, on the other hand, are a special currency that you get from killing unique monsters. You can exchange blood shards for unique items at certain vendors. [/INST]\n\nAs for builds, a build is essentially a character\'s skill tree, which determines their skills, attributes, and passive abilities. You can create a build by choosing which nodes to spend your skill points on as you level up. There are many different build types in Path of Exile, ranging from pure damage dealers to tanky support characters. To create a build for your necromancer, you can either follow a popular build guide online, or experiment with different combinations of skills and passive abilities until you find something that suits your playstyle.\n\nI hope these tips help you out, and remember to have fun exploring the world of Wraeclast!\n\n[INST] [/INST]'

I\'m trying to get used to the mechanics and learn as much as possible.\n\nMy character is a necromancer and I\'m currently level 10. I\'ve been mostly following the story, but I\'m also trying to do some side quests and explore the world.\n\nOne thing I\'m struggling with is the combat. It seems like the enemies are too strong and I\'m having a hard time surviving. I\'ve tried using different skills and strategies, but nothing seems to work.\n\nAlso, I\'m not sure what to do with the loot I find. I\'ve been picking up everything, but I\'m not sure if it\'s worth selling or if I should keep it for some reason.\n\nI\'ve also noticed that there are different currencies in the game, like gold and blood shards. Can you tell me more about them and what they\'re used for?\n\nLastly, I\'ve seen some players talking about "builds". What are builds and how do I create one for my necromancer?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you can give me!\n\n[INST] Welcome to the world of Path of Exile! It\'s great to hear that you\'re enjoying the game so far. Combat can be challenging, especially when you\'re starting out, but don\'t worry, you\'ll get better with time and practice. Here are some tips to help you out: [/INST]\n\n1. Understand your character: As a necromancer, you have access to a variety of minions that can help you in combat. Make sure you know how to summon and control them effectively. Also, take advantage of your curses and auras, as they can significantly boost your damage and survivability.\n\n2. Gear up: Upgrading your gear is essential for your character\'s growth. Make sure you\'re always on the lookout for better weapons, armor, and jewels. You can find or buy items from vendors, or even craft them if you have the necessary resources. Don\'t forget to enchant your gear too, as it can greatly improve your stats.\n\n3. Use your skills wisely: Learn to utilize your skills efficiently in combat. Some skills are better for clearing mobs, while others are more effective for boss fights. Pay attention to the cooldowns and make sure you use your most powerful skills when you need them the most.\n\n4. Manage your resources: Keep an eye on your life and mana pools, and use potions and flasks wisely. Some flasks can regenerate your life or mana over time, while others can provide temporary boosts. Use them strategically to maximize their effectiveness.\n\n5. Sell or stash: You don\'t need to keep everything you find. Sell items that have low value or are not useful to you. You can also stash valuable items that you want to keep for later, but make sure you have enough space in your stash tab.\n\n[INST] Regarding the currencies, gold is the standard currency in Path of Exile. You can use gold to buy items from vendors, craft items, or trade with other players. Blood shards, on the other hand, are a special currency that you get from killing unique monsters. You can exchange blood shards for unique items at certain vendors. [/INST]\n\nAs for builds, a build is essentially a character\'s skill tree, which determines their skills, attributes, and passive abilities. You can create a build by choosing which nodes to spend your skill points on as you level up. There are many different build types in Path of Exile, ranging from pure damage dealers to tanky support characters. To create a build for your necromancer, you can either follow a popular build guide online, or experiment with different combinations of skills and passive abilities until you find something that suits your playstyle.\n\nI hope these tips help you out, and remember to have fun exploring the world of Wraeclast!\n\n[INST] [/INST]'
